this repo is created to explain the concept of modularity how it came about 
why it came about 
starting with first folder step 1 , everything used to be written in one file
As complexity of the application grew splitting javascript into separate script file came into being as shown in step 2

as complexity grew further in an app we had following challenges :
a) global scope pollution => unnecessary overrides when 2 variables in separate script files had same name in global space
so it was necessary to protect the global scope from unnecessary pollution.
b) no built-in way to encapsulate code or create private variables => all variables had to be global "class" keyword did not exist so
it was necessary to come up with approach to have scoped variables 
c) there was no clear a way to organize code into reusable parts without polluting the global scope.
d) javaScript hoisting (the behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope) could sometimes lead to confusing results, especially with variables declared with var.
e) handling asynchronous closures , callbacks =>
s with callbacks and event handlers, IIFEs became a handy way to create closures that encapsulated state and prevented data from being overwritten or shared incorrectly across asynchronous operations.

IIFE's could handle few challenges more neatly overcoming challenges above.
so the evolution of IIFE's came into being as in folder step_3

issue with encapsulation and privacy was gone however as complexity grew even more following challenges came to be :

a)Limited Reusability => IIFEs don't provide a clean way to export or import code across different files or modules.
b)No Dependency Management => IIFEs don't handle dependencies between modules, requiring manual tracking and management of inter-module relationships.
c)Lack of Asynchronous Loading=> IIFEs can't load modules asynchronously, which is critical for performance in large client-side applications.
d)Scaling Challenges=> As applications grow, managing complex code and dependencies with IIFEs becomes cumbersome and error-prone.
e)Global Pollution Risk => IIFEs can still accidentally leak variables into the global scope if not structured carefully, leading to conflicts.

Advent of Commonjs architeture for handling modularity for server side javascript and AMD architecture on client side javascript


CommonJS =>  Server-Side Modularity: Introduced require and module.exports for clean, synchronous module loading on the server. (step_4 folder explains this style of coding although not used much for ui this is to capture the essence and explain basic understanding of this architecture pattern note on browser we need to bundle things to use require keyword this is simulated example)

AMD => Client-Side Asynchronous Loading: Enabled defining dependencies and loading modules asynchronously in the browser to improve performance.(just simulated not running currently the example is for pattern only refer further reading to understand full implementation and difference from commonjs)

we moved to ES6 after the above patterns as:
Unified Standard: ES6 modules created a single, native module system for both browser and server environments.
Synchronous and Asynchronous Support: ES6 modules support both static (synchronous) and dynamic (asynchronous) loading cleanly.
Better Optimization: Native ES6 modules allow browsers and bundlers to perform tree shaking and smarter optimizations.
Simpler Syntax: import and export in ES6 offer a cleaner, more intuitive syntax compared to CommonJS and AMD.
Future Compatibility: ES6 modules are built into the language itself, ensuring long-term consistency and broad ecosystem support.

then step 7 an mjs extension :
In Node.js, by default, .js files are treated as CommonJS (using require/module.exports) unless you explicitly configure otherwise.
If you want to use ES6 module syntax (import/export) without confusion, you need to signal Node.js.
One way is to rename your file to .mjs.
.mjs clearly tells Node: "Hey, this is an ES6 module! Treat import and export as valid."
more details in further reading below.

further reading AMD style what is done in example:
RequireJS (or an AMD Loader):

We include a CDN link to RequireJS in the <head> of the HTML. AMD requires a loader library to work in the browser.
The require object is configured (though in this simple case, no specific configuration is needed).
inputModule.js as an AMD Module:

The original JavaScript code is now wrapped in a define() function.
define() takes a factory function as an argument.
The factory function returns an object containing the functions that this module wants to export (handleNameChange, clearInputName, displayMessage).
Using the Module in the HTML:

Another <script> block uses the require() function (provided by RequireJS) to load the ./inputModule (the .js extension is usually optional).
The require() function takes two arguments:
An array of module dependencies (in this case, just './inputModule').
A callback function that will be executed once the dependencies are loaded. The loaded modules are passed as arguments to this callback (here, inputModule).
Inside the callback, we have an init() function that gets references to the DOM elements and attaches event listeners, using the functions imported from the inputModule.
How it Works (AMD):

When the browser encounters the require() call, RequireJS asynchronously loads inputModule.js.
Once loaded, RequireJS executes the define() function in inputModule.js.
The object returned by the define() factory function becomes the value of the inputModule argument in the callback function of the require() call in the HTML.
The init() function then sets up the event listeners using the functions from the loaded module.
Key Differences from the Original and CommonJS:

define() and require(): AMD uses these functions for module definition and loading, respectively.
Asynchronous Loading: AMD is designed for asynchronous loading of modules, which is well-suited for the browser environment.
Explicit Dependencies: Modules explicitly declare their dependencies as an array in the define() function.
Return Exports: Modules return their exported values from the define() factory function.
To run this example, you would need to either serve the inputModule.js file from a web server in the same directory as your HTML file or ensure that the path in the require(['./inputModule']) call is correct relative to your HTML file.


further reading step 6 ES6 what is done in the pattern (not running on browser due to CORS error screenshot attached)
HTML (index.html):

We've removed the inline onclick and onchange attributes from the HTML elements. Event handling will be managed in the JavaScript modules.
The <script> tag that includes our main JavaScript file (main.js) now has the attribute type="module". This is crucial for the browser to treat the script (and any imported scripts) as ES6 modules.
We've added id attributes (resetButton, displayButton) to the buttons so we can easily target them in our JavaScript.
main.js (Entry Point):

We use the import keyword to bring in the exported functions (handleNameChange, clearInputName, displayMessage) from the ./inputModule.js file. The .js extension in the import path is generally required by browsers.
The init() function gets references to the input and button elements using their ids.
We then attach event listeners (onchange and onclick) to these elements, calling the imported functions.
We use document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', init) to ensure that the JavaScript code runs only after the HTML structure (DOM) has been fully loaded.
inputModule.js (Module Definition):

The original JavaScript functions are kept mostly the same.
We use the export keyword (specifically, named exports within curly braces) to make the handleNameChange, clearInputName, and displayMessage functions available for import by other modules.
To run this ES6 module example:

Save the HTML as index.html, main.js in the same directory, and inputModule.js in the same directory as main.js.
Open index.html in a modern web browser that supports ES6 modules. Most modern browsers have good support for ES6 modules.
You should now have a working example using the ES6 module pattern, with the logic separated into a module and imported into the main script. The event handling is now done programmatically in the JavaScript.

further reading .mjs
Aspect | ES6 Pattern | .mjs Extension
Meaning | import / export syntax | File type telling Node.js it's a module
Usage | Inside JavaScript code | As a filename extension (file.mjs)
Needed in | Any module-based JavaScript code | Node.js when not using "type": "module"
Relation | Defines how code behaves | Defines how file is treated
Example | import { foo } from './bar.js' | Save as bar.mjs if Node.js needs it
